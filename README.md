# CS234-Website

* This is a website created for my CS234 Semester Project.
* Database-driven using MySQL and written in PHP with PDO
* Includes a registration table to store registered users and two other tables in a one-to-many relationship
* Contains full admin CRUD functionality for each table
* Login and register forms are validated and users logging in are authenticated
* All usernames are unique and all passwords are hashed using bcrypt
* Uses sessions to prevent users to access the website without signing in
* Styled using the W3.CSS framework
* Made by Evan Bohler
